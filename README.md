# Pancake-Engraver
CNC engraver for pancakes, cremes brulee and other round things

This repo contains FreeCAD file(s) for the laser holder (for 3D printing) and case (to lasercut), as well as python script to generate the gcode. Also a local copy of the modified GRBL firmware for "lasermode", using z-Axis to control laser intensity.
